### Data Wrangling
- Data integration : combining ```anime_id```, ```user_id, rating```, ```watching_status``` and ```watched_episodes``` from different csv file
- Data cleaning : remove null value, duplicate, and ambiguous data
- Data reduction : remove ```unnamed : 0``` feature

This step can be seen in data-merging.ipynb and data-cleaning.ipynb

### EDA
- Show stastic data from dataset : count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max
- Correlation between numerical feature
- User ratings
- Most common tags with wordcloud
- Data outlier

This step can be seen in exploratory-data-analysis.ipynb

### Data Preparation
- encoding ```user_id``` to integer
- encoding ```anime_id``` to integer
- shuffle data
- ```x``` data : ```user```, ```anime```, ```y``` data : ```rating```
- split data into 80L20 ratio : ```x_train```, ```y_train```, ```x_val```, ```y_val```

This step can be seen in model & evaluation.ipynb

### Modelling
- Model using custom neural network ```RecommenderNet``` from tf.keras.Model, layers used in model like ```Embedding, tensordot and sigmoid```
- Make embedding layers for user_id include : num_users, embedding_size, embedding_initializer ```he_normal``` and embedding_regularizer with learning rate ```(1e-6) / 0.000001```
- user_bias layer for learn bias term for each user in dataset, bias added to the dot of user and anime embedding to user-spesific preferences
- Make embedding layers for anime_id : num_animes, embedding_size, embedding_initializer ```he_normal``` and embedding_regularizer with learning rate ```(1e-6) / 0.000001```
- anime_bias layer is same with user_bias
- make call function for calculate the predicted rating for a user-anime pair. This method takes as input a pair of user-anime represented as integer IDs, and returns a tensor of predicted ratings for each pair.
  - ```user_vector``` : for converts user_id to vector
  - ```user_bias``` : layer assigns a scalar bias value to each user
  - ```anime_vector``` : converts anime_id to vector
  - ```anime_bias``` : same with user_bias but for each anime
  - ```dot_user_anime``` with tensordot : calculate dot product between user and anime vector and gives measure of similarity to embedding space
  - tf.nn.sigmoid : normalize predicted rating between 0 and 1
- make ```model``` variable with parameters : (```num_users```, ```num_animes```, 50 embedfing size)
- model compile :
  - ```loss : BinaryCrossentropy```
  - ```optimizer : Adam(learning_rate = 0.001)```
  - ```metrics : RootMeanSquredError```
- train model :
  - ```batch_size = 8```
  - ```epochs = 20```
- model summary :

### Evaluation

Root Mean Squared Error :

- Visualize metrics root mean squared error and loss over epochs, result :
  - RMSE :

  - Loss :

   It seems that the training process is making some progress but the validation loss and validation root mean squared error (RMSE) are not decreasing much after the third epoch.
   Looking at the output, it appears that the model starts with a loss of 0.6304 and RMSE of 0.2328 on the training set and a loss of 0.6155 and RMSE of 0.2170 on the validation set. As the model is trained for more epochs, the loss and RMSE values decrease for both the training and validation sets, indicating that the model is learning to predict better. However, the improvement seems to level off after around 10 epochs, with little change in the validation set performance after this point.
   However, the fact that the validation set performance is fairly close to the training set performance throughout training suggests that the model is not overfitting, which is a positive sign.
   
   _we could have improved it further, but we discovered errors in the data, so we didn't do it KEKW_
